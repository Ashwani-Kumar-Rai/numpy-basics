The ndarray is a fast, flexible, and memory-efficient alternative to Python's built-in lists, and it provides many useful methods for working with arrays, such as reshaping, indexing, and mathematical operations. The dimensionality of an ndarray is specified by its \"shape,\" which is a tuple of integers representing the size of each dimension.\n"

It is a multi-dimensional, homogeneous collection of elements, which can be either a one-dimensional array (vector) or a two-dimensional array (matrix), or even higher-dimensional arrays with more than two dimensions. The distinction between an array and a matrix is often based on the context in which they are used. In general, arrays are used to store sequences of elements, while matrices are used to represent two-dimensional numerical tables. However, in NumPy, the term \"ndarray\" is used to refer to arrays of any dimensionality, including both arrays and matrices."
